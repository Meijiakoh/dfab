                    <h3>Week 5</h3>
                    <p>We received the mechanism of the music box. I recorded the measurement of the mechanism and started sketching each piece of wood using Fusion360. Throughout the process, I seek help form the lecturer to clarify my doubts.</p>

                    <h3>Week 6</h3>
                    <p>We were given the task to produce a 3D Knight Chess Model. I looked for images from the internet and imported it into Fusion 360. I discovered a few tools that I have not used before and it was very interesting to learn. I outlined the canvas image and extrude the upper part of the chess piece and used the revolve tools for the bottom part. After completing the drawing, I downloaded the file in Stereolithography format file and imported it into Ultimaker Cura. I made a few adjusments and sliced my model. It was very fulfilling as I have never 3D print a model from an image.</p>

                    <h3>Week 8</h3>
                    <p>We were divided into groups to go down the lab with laser cutting machines to learn about process of laser cutting. I have learnt about the sequence of how to switch on and off the machine. Besides, I have learnt about some of the important switches that can shut the whole machine down in the case of emergency. We were introduced to the machine and taught how to use the laser cutting machine, we were given the oppurtunity to cut the PPVC.</p>
